Reports packages that contain classes but do not contain a <b>package-info.java</b> or <b>package.html</b> file and thus are
missing package documentation.
Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
<em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
